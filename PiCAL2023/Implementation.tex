Maude is a powerful tool for implementing various semantics to experiment with quick prototypes for trying examples and proving properties. It is a high-level language and high-performance system supporting equational and rewriting logic computation. We use Maude as a metalanguage in which the syntax and semantics of the CCAL  can be formally defined. It is easier to scale the implementation based on the executable in Maude. We have formalized the operational semantics,  which provides a prototypic environment for our specification. We validate the running example from the case study with two versions, consented and unconsented specifications. The full executable in Maude and the running example can be downloaded from \url{https://github.com/Chinmayiprabhu/CCALexecutable.git}.
